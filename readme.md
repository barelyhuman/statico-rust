# statico-rust

[statico](https://github.com/barelyhuman/statico) but in rust.

Reasons

- To test the difference in development work
- Maybe learn a bit of rust while I'm at it
- See if the 2 languages does bring in significant performance difference (if
  not, I'll be sticking to go for most of the work)
- and , cause it's fun
